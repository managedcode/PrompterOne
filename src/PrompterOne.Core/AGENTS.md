## Project Purpose

`PrompterOne.Core` is the host-neutral domain layer.

It owns TPS parsing, compilation, export, RSVP helpers, preview and workspace state, media scene models, and streaming provider descriptors.

## Entry Points

- `Tps/*`
- `Editor/*`
- `Workspace/*`
- `Library/*`
- `Rsvp/*`
- `Media/*`
- `Streaming/*`
- `Localization/*`

## Boundaries

- No Blazor dependencies.
- No JavaScript interop.
- No browser or server runtime assumptions.
- Keep abstractions, models, preview helpers, and services colocated inside their owning feature slices.
- Keep types serializable and reusable from the WebAssembly app.

## Project-Local Commands

- `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterOne/src/PrompterOne.Core/PrompterOne.Core.csproj`
- `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterOne/tests/PrompterOne.Core.Tests/PrompterOne.Core.Tests.csproj`

## Applicable Skills

- no special skill is required for most core work; follow the root repo policy and architecture map first

## Local Risks Or Protected Areas

- TPS compatibility matters more than cosmetic refactors.
- `Models/` and legacy `Services/` roots should not become new flat dumping grounds; prefer the owning feature slice first.
- Do not let UI-specific shortcuts leak into domain parsing or RSVP behavior.
- Respect root maintainability limits. Large parser/compiler edits need explicit decomposition or documented exceptions.
