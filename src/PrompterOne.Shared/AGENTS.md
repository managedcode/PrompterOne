## Project Purpose

`PrompterOne.Shared` contains the routed Razor UI, shipped runtime CSS assets, thin browser interop, and browser-side service wiring.

## Entry Points

- `AppShell/Routes.razor`
- `AppShell/Layout/MainLayout.razor`
- `AppShell/Services/PrompterOneServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
- `Editor/*`
- `Library/*`
- `Learn/*`
- `Teleprompter/*`
- `GoLive/*`
- `Settings/*`
- `Diagnostics/*`
- `Media/*`
- `wwwroot/design/*`
- `Diagnostics/Services/BrowserConnectivityService.cs`
- `Diagnostics/Components/ConnectivityOverlay.razor`
- `wwwroot/media/browser-media.js`

## Boundaries

- Keep markup aligned with the shipped routed UI patterns and shared runtime CSS assets.
- Do not add or depend on the deleted root `design/` prototype folder. Final routed UI must be authored as Blazor components and C#-owned state in this project.
- For parity work, fix the whole routed screen structure and intended interactions in Blazor instead of approximating only selected sections.
- Keep routed pages, feature components, renderers, and feature-local services inside their owning slice folders.
- Keep app-specific UI logic here, but keep business rules in `PrompterOne.Core`.
- User-facing library, editor, learn, and reader summaries must come from real TPS-derived metrics, never from `display_*` metadata or other presentation-only hardcoded overrides.
- Keep feature styles owned by their routed screen; `Learn` and `Teleprompter` must not share one feature stylesheet manifest.
- Preserve dedicated test selectors used by Playwright and keep one selector format only: `data-test`.
- Do not add server-only dependencies.
- Keep keyboard shortcuts, screen ids/selectors, and reusable UI constants in Blazor/C# contracts when possible; leave JS only with unavoidable browser API interop and direct DOM work that Blazor cannot replace cleanly.
- Graph and canvas viewer JavaScript must stay a thin renderer interop layer. Blazor/C# components must own graph view modes, labels, app color token mapping, and product UI vocabulary, then pass that configuration into JS instead of hardcoding those rules in script files.
- Script graph visuals must prioritize readable story knowledge: node labels and descriptions should be visible and meaningful, and line-number nodes, source-line link clutter, or clipped TPS attribute strings must not be presented as primary graph knowledge.
- Script graph labels, tooltips, semantic scopes, tokenizer chunks, and graph markdown input must render compiled TPS display text from the Core TPS SDK path, matching the clean prompter text; raw TPS markup is only allowed as hidden source-range/metadata input and must not be cleaned after the fact for visible prose.
- Script graph renderer code must delete obsolete visual branches for source-only or TPS-attribute-only node kinds such as raw `Line`, `Pace`, `Timing`, or `Cue`; those values belong in source ranges, metadata, or tooltips only when they add meaning, not as primary graph nodes or edge clutter.
- Script graph tooltips must anchor beside the hovered node or edge using pointer/object geometry; never let graph tooltips fall back to random top-left or detached viewport positions.
- Script graph colors must use subdued app-owned tokens for readable dark-surface graph nodes with semantic accents; avoid pale, saturated, or randomly mixed blobs that fight the PrompterOne palette.
- Script graph content must behave like a writer knowledge map: include meaningful ideas, themes, people, story references, and document structure that navigate back to the editor text, not only technical TPS headers or graph-layout placeholders.
- Script graph UI must expose an intentional analysis path when richer extraction is needed, and every graph mode should answer a concrete writer question such as "what is this about", "how are blocks connected", "which terms recur", "which references matter", or "where should I edit this idea".
- Script graph UI must not silently fall back to regex/keyword semantic extraction when LLM graph extraction is unavailable; regex, stop-word, capitalization, keyword, and hardcoded-domain semantic heuristics are strictly forbidden. In that state, show an explicit action to connect AI or run tokenizer/vector similarity analysis; the tokenizer path must be user-visible as a lower-fidelity fallback, not disguised as LLM semantic understanding.
- Script graph UI should surface tokenizer/vector similarity through the `ManagedCode.MarkdownLd.Kb` tokenizer path when available; do not add a separate browser or Shared-owned tokenizer implementation for the same fallback.
- Assistant spotlight suggestions and script graph UI must not use ad-hoc language heuristics for intent or similarity. Use LLM-backed semantics when available, or explicit tokenizer/vector similarity over localized action descriptions and the user query when a non-LLM fallback is needed.
- Script graph editing must support a split source/graph workflow: the user should be able to inspect the graph beside the editor, click a meaningful graph node, and have the owning source range revealed or highlighted without leaving the graph workspace.
- Script graph split mode must expose a user-resizable divider between source and graph panes, and graph view must also support a graph-only workspace mode for focused exploration.
- Script graph nodes must explain article/book meaning through themes, terms, entities, characters, concepts, claims, and references; do not let generic layout groupings or unexplained extracted snippets dominate the graph.
- Script graph controls must expose an explicit auto-layout action so users can recover a readable layout after a broken preset, resize, drag, pan, or zoom interaction without rebuilding the document.
- Script graph layout presets must remain readable with PrompterOne's rectangular text nodes; do not add or keep a G6 layout mode without explicit node-size spacing, overlap prevention, or a deterministic fallback that prevents stacked or clipped node labels.
- Script graph node shapes must fit the graph-reading task, not default to square UI cards everywhere: use graph-native visual language such as topic bubbles, entity dots, document anchors, cluster hulls, and weighted compact labels by semantic role and zoom level.
- Prefer removing JS files that only orchestrate UI behavior, reader state, or shell interactions; keep those flows in Razor components or C# services and let JS expose only the minimal browser or SDK call surface.
- TPS 1.1.0 removed legacy inline color tags, so editor, reader, menus, examples, and tests in this project must not expose or insert `[red]`, `[green]`, or other deprecated color-tag authoring paths.
- Editor dropdowns and tooltips must read as structured surfaces: item rows need a consistent visual rhythm with aligned columns or spacing, and overlay surfaces need border contrast strong enough to separate them clearly from the editor background.
- Editor dropdown rows must stay compact menu rows, not stacks of tall rounded mini-cards; overlays may feel premium, but menu items still need fast scannable list rhythm.
- Dropdown item content across `PrompterOne.Shared` must align from the left edge as one readable cluster; do not push tags, shortcuts, or meta copy to a fake right column inside menu rows.
- Tooltip surfaces across the app must feel intentional and premium: compact, aligned, clearly separated from the background, and positioned so they do not clip, overlap, or awkwardly fight the control that owns them.
- Editor header toolbar tooltips must reveal more slowly than dropdown intent so quick menu interactions open the dropdown without competing hover tooltip paint.
- Repeated menus, dropdowns, tooltips, badges, icon rows, image wrappers, and similar visual chrome must be standardized as reusable Blazor components with owning styles; routed pages and catalog files must compose those components instead of embedding bespoke markup or inline visual logic.
- Shared shell chrome such as the global `Go Live` entry must live behind one reusable Blazor component; routed pages must not fork their own spacing, icon color, or idle/active variants.
- Editor TPS menus in `PrompterOne.Shared` must use one spec-driven grouping and command inventory across top toolbar, floating toolbar, and Monaco authoring help; if a TPS tag or header pattern is supported, every relevant editor command surface must expose it coherently.
- `PrompterOne.Shared` must provide a localized first-run onboarding flow that walks new users through PrompterOne, TPS, RSVP, Editor, Learn, Teleprompter, and Go Live, and it must persist completion or dismissal in browser-owned settings.
- `PrompterOne.Shared` onboarding must give TPS its own dedicated explainer step or page, separate from the editor overview, so new users understand what TPS is and why PrompterOne centers it.
- The TPS onboarding content in `PrompterOne.Shared` must speak to beginners directly: define TPS, explain why plain-text teleprompter markup matters, show how PrompterOne carries that source into rehearsal/reading/live flows, and point users to official TPS documentation or glossary paths for deeper orientation.
- Library and editor routed surfaces in `PrompterOne.Shared` must expose real search affordances for script names and script content instead of relying only on manual browsing.
- Teleprompter routed surfaces in `PrompterOne.Shared` must expose a direct in-reader text-size control, owned by the reader UI itself, so operators can tune readability during playback without leaving the route.
- Teleprompter width controls in `PrompterOne.Shared` must scale relative to the active viewport or screen size and persist that adaptive ratio; do not clamp the readable lane around a fixed pixel-only desktop maximum.
- Teleprompter width controls in `PrompterOne.Shared` must map to the real visible text lane; when the user drives `Read Width` to `100%`, the reader must not keep extra inner shell padding or centered shrink-wrap gaps inside that lane.
- Editor gutter line numbers must read as editor chrome, not as part of the script content; their color and emphasis must stay clearly separated from source text.
- Editor wrap/format commands must not partially capture TPS tag syntax or create accidental nested wrappers by spanning across existing tag boundaries; if the selection touches tag markup, normalize or reject it instead of producing broken mixed-tag output.
- File-creating editor actions such as document split must show explicit in-app feedback about what was created and where to find it; silent success states behind generic buttons are not user-friendly enough.
- Settings panels and provider cards in `PrompterOne.Shared` must render collapsed by default on first open; do not auto-expand AI, cloud, appearance, about, or similar settings cards unless the user explicitly opens them or a task-specific interaction requires it after load.
- Desktop settings layout in `PrompterOne.Shared` must use the available main content width instead of constraining routed sections to a narrow centered column with a mid-screen scrollbar; settings forms should expand across the settings workspace unless a specific sub-surface documents a narrower contract.

## Project-Local Commands

- `dotnet build ./src/PrompterOne.Shared/PrompterOne.Shared.csproj`
- `dotnet test ./tests/PrompterOne.Web.Tests/PrompterOne.Web.Tests.csproj`
- `dotnet test ./tests/PrompterOne.Web.UITests/PrompterOne.Web.UITests.csproj`

## Applicable Skills

- `playwright` for routed UI verification and interaction debugging

## Local Risks Or Protected Areas

- Small class-name changes can break visual fidelity badly because the shared runtime CSS is cross-cutting.
- `AppShell`, `Contracts`, `Localization`, and `wwwroot` are cross-cutting; do not turn them back into dumping grounds for feature code.
- Routed shell and page navigation belong in Blazor; keep remaining `wwwroot` JavaScript limited to browser/runtime interop.
- JS interop and saved browser state are part of the real runtime contract; do not treat them as decorative.
