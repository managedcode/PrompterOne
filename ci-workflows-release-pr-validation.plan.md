# CI Workflows: PR Validation And Release Plan

## Task Goal

Reshape the repository CI/CD so `PrompterLive` has:

- a clearly named pull-request validation workflow that runs build and tests for PRs
- a clearly named release workflow that builds the standalone app, creates or updates the release tag, publishes a GitHub Release, and keeps GitHub Pages deployment aligned with the release flow
- workflow naming and documentation that match the new ownership clearly

## Scope

### In Scope

- Audit the current `.github/workflows/*.yml` layout and identify gaps against the requested CI/CD shape.
- Add or update GitHub Actions workflows for PR validation and release automation.
- Rename workflows to explicit, purpose-driven names.
- Update repo documentation and architecture/build-governance notes where the canonical workflow ownership changes.
- Push the workflow changes and observe the resulting GitHub Actions runs.

### Out Of Scope

- Runtime feature changes in `src/` or `tests/`.
- Versioning model changes beyond what the release workflow needs to tag and publish releases safely.
- Non-GitHub CI providers or external package registries.

## Current State

- The existing GitHub Pages workflow now deploys successfully, but the deployed runtime is broken on `prompter.managed-code.com` because the artifact rewrote `<base href>` to `"/PrompterLive/"`.
- A dedicated PR validation workflow has been added locally but not pushed yet.
- The release workflow has been expanded locally into build/test -> publish -> GitHub Release -> GitHub Pages stages, but GitHub has not run that shape yet.
- Workflow naming is being normalized across repository automation.
- GitHub run `23814159539` proved that `dotnet test PrompterLive.slnx --no-build` is not a safe CI test shape for this repo because it launches the UI browser suite alongside the supporting test assemblies.

## Constraints

- Keep the runtime browser-only and GitHub Pages compatible.
- Reuse repo-native commands from `AGENTS.md` instead of inventing alternate CI commands.
- Keep workflow ownership explicit: PR validation, release automation, and Pages deployment should each have clear triggers and names.
- Preserve automated app version injection from CI metadata.

## Risks

- A release workflow can create accidental duplicate tags if version calculation is not deterministic.
- Running deploy on the wrong trigger can cause duplicate Pages publishes or mismatched release metadata.
- Workflow naming or trigger changes can break existing contributor expectations if docs are not updated in the same task.
- End-to-end proof requires real GitHub Actions runs after push, not only local YAML linting.

## Testing Methodology

- Inventory baseline: capture current workflow files, names, and trigger responsibilities.
- Local workflow validation: run `actionlint` over all edited workflow files.
- Repo quality validation: run the repo `build`, `test`, and `format` commands that the new workflows are expected to own or depend on.
- GitHub validation: push the workflow changes, then watch the resulting Actions runs for PR/release/deploy-relevant jobs and confirm final status from GitHub.

Quality bar:

- Workflow names are explicit and stable.
- PR workflow runs repo build and tests on pull requests.
- Release workflow can derive a release version/tag and publish a GitHub Release without manual retagging steps.
- Pages deployment remains green under the updated workflow topology.

## Baseline Gap Tracking

- [x] `Missing PR validation workflow`: the repo lacked a dedicated, clearly named pull-request pipeline for build plus test.
  - Root cause note: only the Pages deploy workflow exists for app CI, so merge validation is coupled to post-push deployment instead of PR checks.
  - Intended fix path: add a PR validation workflow with repo-native build/test commands and clear naming.
  - Fix status: implemented locally

- [x] `Missing release workflow`: the repo lacked a dedicated workflow that creates or updates a release tag and publishes a GitHub Release.
  - Root cause note: current automation reacts to already-published releases but does not create them.
  - Intended fix path: add a release automation workflow that computes the release version, creates/updates the tag, and publishes the GitHub Release.
  - Fix status: implemented locally

- [x] `Workflow naming drift`: current workflow names did not fully reflect their actual purpose.
  - Root cause note: naming evolved around a single Pages deployment path instead of a full CI/CD model.
  - Intended fix path: rename workflows to purpose-specific names and update docs that reference them.
  - Fix status: implemented locally

- [x] `Broken custom-domain boot`: the deployed Pages artifact rewrote `<base href>` to `"/PrompterLive/"`, causing `_content` and `_framework` assets to resolve under a non-existent repo subpath on the custom domain.
  - Root cause note: the workflow still assumed repository Pages path hosting while the repo is configured for a custom-domain root deployment.
  - Intended fix path: keep `PAGES_BASE_PATH` at `/`, preserve root-relative asset loading, and ship `CNAME` in the Pages artifact.
  - Fix status: implemented locally, pending GitHub deploy verification

- [ ] `CI browser-suite contention`: GitHub run `23814159539` failed while `dotnet test PrompterLive.slnx --no-build` launched the browser suite in parallel with the supporting test assemblies.
  - Root cause note: `PrompterLive.App.UITests` self-hosts shared WASM build assets and the repo rules require it to own those assets inside a dedicated `dotnet test` process.
  - Intended fix path: split CI validation into sequential project-scoped `dotnet test` steps and keep the browser suite isolated after the supporting suites pass.
  - Fix status: implemented locally, pending GitHub verification

Root-cause note:
- The failing list spans library, editor, teleprompter, navigation, media, and go-live flows, which points to shared browser-harness contention rather than a single routed feature regression.

## Ordered Implementation Plan

1. Baseline inventory
   - Action: record the current workflow files, names, triggers, and the latest successful GitHub Pages deploy run.
   - Where: `.github/workflows/` and GitHub Actions metadata.
   - Verification before moving on: this plan explicitly captures the current gap list and the latest deploy status.

2. Versioning and release-shape review
   - Action: inspect `Directory.Build.props` and existing versioning docs to derive a deterministic release tag strategy that fits the current app version model.
   - Where: `Directory.Build.props`, `docs/Architecture.md`, and `docs/Features/AppVersioningAndGitHubPages.md`.
   - Verification before moving on: choose one release tag format and ensure it maps cleanly to the current build metadata.

3. Workflow design
   - Action: define the final workflow split, triggers, permissions, and artifact boundaries for PR validation, release automation, and Pages deployment.
   - Where: this plan and the target workflow YAML files.
   - Verification before moving on: the plan identifies which workflow owns which trigger and why.

4. Implement workflow updates
   - Action: create or update workflow YAML files for PR validation and release automation, and rename or refine the Pages deploy workflow as needed.
   - Where: `.github/workflows/`.
   - Verification before moving on: each workflow has clear naming, explicit triggers, and repo-native commands.

5. Update documentation
   - Action: update architecture/build-governance and feature docs so they describe the new workflow ownership, trigger model, and release/tag behavior.
   - Where: `docs/Architecture.md` and `docs/Features/AppVersioningAndGitHubPages.md`.
   - Verification before moving on: docs point to the new canonical workflows and keep Mermaid diagrams/rendering intact.

6. Local validation
   - Action: run `actionlint`, repo `build`, repo `test`, and repo `format`.
   - Where: repo root.
   - Verification before moving on: all local validation commands pass against the new workflow/docs state.

7. Push and observe GitHub runs
   - Action: commit and push only the scoped workflow/doc updates, then watch the relevant GitHub Actions runs to final status.
   - Where: `origin/main` unless the user redirects branch strategy.
   - Verification before moving on: GitHub shows the updated workflows and the triggered runs complete successfully or any remaining failure is captured with root cause.

8. Final closeout
   - Action: update this plan with the actual workflow names, validation evidence, and any residual GitHub-only caveats.
   - Where: this plan file and final task summary.
   - Verification before moving on: all checklist items are complete and each tracked gap is marked done or explicitly explained.

## Results So Far

- Confirmed via `curl` that the broken public deploy served `<base href="/PrompterLive/">` on `prompter.managed-code.com`, which produced 404s for `/_content/*` and `/_framework/*` assets under the wrong subpath.
- Added `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` with a dedicated `Build And Test` job for pull requests.
- Converted `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` into a staged `Release Pipeline` that now performs build/test first, resolves the release version from `Directory.Build.props`, publishes the release bundle, publishes a GitHub Release, and only then deploys GitHub Pages.
- Updated all `actions/*` usages in repo workflows to the latest official major versions currently published by GitHub:
  - `actions/checkout@v6`
  - `actions/configure-pages@v6`
  - `actions/deploy-pages@v5`
  - `actions/setup-dotnet@v5`
  - `actions/upload-artifact@v7`
  - `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4`
  - `actions/download-artifact@v8`
  - `actions/setup-python@v6`
  - `actions/setup-node@v6`
  - `actions/github-script@v8`
- Local verification passed:
  - `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`
  - `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
  - `dotnet format /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
- GitHub run `23814159539` failed in `Build And Test` because solution-level `dotnet test` launched `PrompterLive.App.UITests` alongside the supporting test assemblies; the next fix is to split CI test execution into sequential project-scoped steps.
- Updated `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` so CI now runs:
  - `dotnet test tests/PrompterLive.Core.Tests/PrompterLive.Core.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet test tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet test tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/PrompterLive.App.UITests.csproj --no-build`
- Local validation for the split test shape passed:
  - `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`
  - `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.Core.Tests/PrompterLive.Core.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `node /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/bin/Debug/net10.0/.playwright/package/cli.js install chromium`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/PrompterLive.App.UITests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet format /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
- GitHub runs `23814810144` and `23814814816` proved that workflow-level isolation alone was not enough; the browser suite still failed under GitHub Linux with 25-28 flaky editor, go-live, and teleprompter tests.
- The remaining GitHub-only root causes were narrowed to:
  - mac-only keyboard shortcuts in UI tests (`Meta+A`, `Meta+Z`, `Meta+Shift+Z`) that broke Linux editor shortcuts and typing flows
  - browser-suite self-contention from `4` parallel xUnit workers inside one process on the slower GitHub runner
  - route/readiness assertions still relying on Playwright's short default timeouts instead of the suite's WASM-specific timeout budget
- GitHub runs `23815330400` and `23815334683` proved the stability fixes removed all but one browser failure:
  - `PrompterLive.App.UITests.EditorFloatingToolbarLayoutTests.EditorScreen_FloatingToolbarStaysPinnedAfterFloatingFormatAction`
  - Root cause note: the test asserted `getBoundingClientRect().x/y` drift after the format action even though the production floating-toolbar contract preserves the inline/computed anchor (`left` and `top`) and the element itself is centered with `transform: translate(-50%, ...)`. Linux font/layout differences moved the rendered box without breaking the preserved anchor.
  - Intended fix path: assert the preserved computed anchor coordinates instead of bounding-box drift, and keep the visibility check after the floating action.
- GitHub runs `23815986364` and `23815989928` showed the browser failures were not purely test-level:
  - `EditorScreen_FloatingToolbarStaysPinnedAfterFloatingFormatAction` still failed because a late textarea `select` event could request a fresh floating-bar re-anchor after toolbar formatting on Linux.
  - `EditorScreen_FloatingToolbarStaysAboveMultiLineSelection` failed because the visual floating-toolbar gap above the selected segment line was too tight for Linux font metrics.
  - Intended fix path: preserve the existing floating-bar anchor when the refreshed DOM selection matches the already-tracked range, and increase the runtime floating-toolbar gap so the toolbar body clears multi-line selections consistently across platforms.
- GitHub run `23816573578` isolated the remaining release-only browser failure after the floating-toolbar fixes:
  - `EditorScreen_QuantumTypingKeepsStyledOverlayVisibleResponsive`
  - Root cause note: the test asserted a hard `maxLatency <= 120ms` on the single slowest MutationObserver sample, which was sensitive to one-off runner scheduling spikes in the release workflow even when the same Linux browser suite passed in `PR Validation`.
  - Intended fix path: keep the strong no-visible-input/no-long-task checks, but evaluate typing responsiveness with a bounded spike plus a stable `p95` latency threshold instead of a single-sample maximum.
- GitHub run `23817217598` confirmed a workflow-level difference still remained after the typing-probe stabilization:
  - `PR Validation` run `23817221509` passed on the same commit while the release workflow still failed in `Build And Test`.
  - Root cause note: the release workflow exported Pages and release publishing variables globally, so the validation job did not actually run under the same environment contract as `PR Validation`.
  - Intended fix path: scope release-only environment variables to the release-preparation and publish jobs, leaving the release validation job with the same build/test environment as `PR Validation`.
- Local validation after the browser-suite stability fixes passed:
  - `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.Core.Tests/PrompterLive.Core.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/PrompterLive.App.UITests.csproj --no-build`
- Local validation after the floating-toolbar anchor assertion fix passed:
  - `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/PrompterLive.App.UITests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet format /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
- Local validation after the runtime floating-toolbar fixes passed:
  - `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests/PrompterLive.App.Tests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/PrompterLive.App.UITests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet format /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
- Local validation after the typing-latency probe stabilization passed:
  - `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
  - `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/tests/PrompterLive.App.UITests/PrompterLive.App.UITests.csproj --no-build`
  - `dotnet format /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
- Local workflow validation after the release-env scoping fix passed:
  - `actionlint /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/.github/workflows/*.yml`

## Final Validation Skills And Commands

1. `dotnet-quality-ci`
   - Reason: keep CI workflows aligned with repo-native .NET quality gates instead of ad-hoc commands.
   - Concrete outcome: workflow commands mapped to repo-defined build/test/format gates.

2. GitHub Actions inspection
   - Reason: verify workflow topology and the final run status from GitHub, not only local YAML parsing.
   - Concrete outcome: run URLs and final conclusions for the updated workflows.

3. `actionlint`
   - Reason: validate workflow syntax locally before push.
   - Command: `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`
   - Concrete outcome: no workflow lint errors.

4. Repo build
   - Reason: prove the PR validation workflow’s build command is green.
   - Command: `dotnet build /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx -warnaserror`
   - Concrete outcome: successful solution build.

5. Repo test
   - Reason: prove the PR validation workflow’s test command is green.
   - Command: `dotnet test /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
   - Concrete outcome: successful repo test pass.

6. Repo format
   - Reason: satisfy the repo-required quality pass after workflow/docs changes.
   - Command: `dotnet format /Users/ksemenenko/Developer/PrompterLive/PrompterLive.slnx`
   - Concrete outcome: successful formatting pass.
