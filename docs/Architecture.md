# PrompterOne Architecture

## Intent

`PrompterOne` is a standalone Blazor WebAssembly teleprompter app.

The acceptance target is a browser-only runtime that:

- matches the local `design/` UI closely
- parses and exports TPS content
- supports RSVP learn mode and teleprompter reading mode
- keeps media, scene, and streaming state client-side
- ships all automated tests under `tests/`

There is no backend in the runtime architecture.

## Architecture Document Contract

`docs/Architecture.md` is the required entry point before any non-trivial change.

Every agent or contributor must read it first to answer three questions before editing:

1. where the target behavior lives
2. which component owns the change
3. which boundary must stay untouched

This document must stay detailed enough that a new contributor can use it as the primary map for both implementation and discovery.

It must always include:

- the full app structure and how the top-level projects relate
- every major component or feature slice with:
  - what it is
  - why it exists
  - where it lives in the repo
  - what it owns
  - what it must not own
- the design principles that drive UI implementation
- the architecture and dependency principles that drive code placement
- the main places to look when adding, debugging, or reshaping behavior
- Mermaid diagrams that render and reflect the current structure

If a change introduces a new major component, moves ownership, or changes how contributors should discover the code, update this document in the same task.

```

## Vertical Slice Layout

- `src/PrompterOne.Shared` keeps routed UI in feature slices: `AppShell`, `Diagnostics`, `Editor`, `Library`, `Learn`, `Teleprompter`, `GoLive`, `Settings`, and `Media`.
- `src/PrompterOne.Core` keeps host-neutral behavior in matching domain slices: `Tps`, `Editor`, `Workspace`, `Library`, `Rsvp`, `Media`, `Streaming`, and `Localization`.
- `tests/PrompterOne.Core.Tests`, `tests/PrompterOne.App.Tests`, and `tests/PrompterOne.App.UITests` mirror those feature slices and reserve `Support` or `Infrastructure` for shared harness code.

## Design And Structure Principles

### UI Design Principles

- `design/` is the visual source of truth for layout, hierarchy, spacing, controls, color direction, and interaction tone.
- UI work should port markup, structure, and class intent from `design/` instead of inventing a parallel design language.
- Routed screens should keep strong visual identities while still using the shared shell and contracts from `AppShell`.
- Stable `data-testid` hooks are part of the UI contract, not optional test-only extras.
- Browser-first behavior matters more than server assumptions. Media, storage, and stream state stay client-side.

### Code Structure Principles

- `src/PrompterOne.App` hosts only bootstrapping and runtime startup concerns.
- `src/PrompterOne.Shared` owns routed pages, Razor components, CSS, UI state wiring, and browser interop.
- `src/PrompterOne.Core` owns reusable domain logic, parsing, workspace state, media models, and streaming logic.
- `tests/` mirrors production ownership and proves behavior through real UI, component, and core flows.
- New code should be added where the owning boundary already lives; do not create duplicate feature centers.

## Component Ownership Map

| Component / Slice | What It Is | Why It Exists | Where It Lives | Owns | Must Not Own |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Build Governance

- `Directory.Packages.props` is the canonical source for NuGet package versions.
- `Directory.Build.props` is the canonical source for shared target framework, analyzer policy, and assembly/app version settings.
- `global.json` pins the expected .NET SDK for local and CI builds.
- `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` is the canonical pull-request validation flow for repo build and test gates; it runs the browser-realistic Playwright suite in a dedicated `dotnet test` step after the non-browser test projects finish.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` is the canonical release pipeline for the standalone WASM app: build and test, resolve the release version from `Directory.Build.props`, publish the release artifact, publish the GitHub Release, and deploy GitHub Pages on the custom-domain root. Its validation job isolates `PrompterOne.App.UITests` from the supporting test projects so the self-hosted browser harness owns the test assets during its run.
- Vendored browser SDK release pins live in `vendored-streaming-sdks.json`, and the exact release sync or watch flow is documented in `docs/Features/VendoredStreamingSdkReleases.md`.

## Runtime Boundaries

    BrowserStorage["Browser storage + repository adapters<br/>scripts + folders + settings"]
    CloudStorage["Cloud provider orchestration<br/>snapshot import/export"]

    Ui --> BrowserStorage
    Ui --> CloudStorage
    BrowserStorage --> WebApis

```

- Same-origin tab coordination is a browser-runtime concern owned in `PrompterOne.Shared`; it uses `BroadcastChannel` as a best-effort browser transport and does not change the browser-only runtime shape.

## Cross-Tab Runtime Contracts

```mermaid

    SettingsPage["SettingsPage"]
    SettingsStore["BrowserSettingsStore"]
    GoLivePage["GoLivePage"]
    GoLiveSession["GoLiveSessionService"]
    MessageBus["CrossTabMessageBus"]
    JsBridge["wwwroot/app/cross-tab-message-bus.js"]
    OtherTabStore["BrowserSettingsStore<br/>other tab"]
    OtherTabSession["GoLiveSessionService<br/>other tab"]
    ThemeService["BrowserThemeService"]
    Shell["MainLayout"]

    MessageBus --> JsBridge
    JsBridge --> OtherTabStore
    JsBridge --> OtherTabSession
    OtherTabStore --> ThemeService
    OtherTabSession --> Shell
```

- `CrossTabMessageBus` is the reusable same-origin messaging entry point for browser tabs.
- `BrowserSettingsStore` is the current publisher and fan-out point for remote settings refresh.
- `BrowserThemeService` is the first concrete remote consumer and keeps shell appearance aligned across tabs without reload.
- `GoLiveSessionService` is the current publisher and consumer for active `Go Live` session snapshots, including startup catch-up requests.
- `MainLayout` consumes `GoLiveSessionService` and renders the global shell `Go Live` status for every screen.
- `AppShellService` owns the current in-app route and the last valid non-`Go Live` return target so the `Go Live` back control can return to the actual previous screen instead of a hardcoded reader route.
- The contract must stay message-based; tabs do not share live .NET memory.

## Library Contracts

```

## Storage And Cloud Contracts

    BrowserStore["BrowserCloudStorageStore"]
    Preferences["CloudStoragePreferences"]
    UserSettings["IUserSettingsStore<br/>BrowserSettingsStore localStorage implementation"]
    Transfer["CloudStorageTransferService"]
    ProviderFactory["CloudStorageProviderFactory"]
    LocalRepo["BrowserScriptRepository + BrowserLibraryFolderRepository"]
    LocalVfs["IVirtualFileSystem"]
    ScriptRepo["BrowserScriptRepository"]
    FolderRepo["BrowserLibraryFolderRepository"]
    BrowserProvider["ManagedCode.Storage.Browser"]
    Providers["Dropbox / OneDrive / Google Drive / GCS / CloudKit"]

    Settings --> BrowserStore
    Settings --> Transfer
    BrowserStore --> Preferences
    BrowserStore --> UserSettings
    Transfer --> ProviderFactory
    Transfer --> LocalVfs
    ScriptRepo --> LocalRepo
    FolderRepo --> LocalRepo
    LocalVfs --> BrowserProvider
    ProviderFactory --> Providers
```

- Scripts and folders persist through authoritative browser repositories backed by versioned JSON/localStorage materialization.
- Browser `localStorage` is reserved for provider credentials, provider metadata, and lightweight settings values that must survive reloads.
- Routed pages and browser services should depend on `IUserSettingsStore` for persisted user preferences; `BrowserSettingsStore` is the browser-only implementation detail behind that contract.
- Browser storage plus VFS stay registered for cloud import/export and future stream-export work, but they are not the primary editor/library persistence path today.
- Cloud import/export currently moves one scripts-and-settings snapshot at a time; it is not a live sync engine and does not own recorded video upload.

## Editor Authoring Contracts

    end
```

## Media Permission Model

- Browser-first WASM is the only active runtime today, so media access comes from browser origin permissions.
- Keep local development on the stable launch-settings origin. Do not rotate ports randomly because camera and microphone permissions are origin-bound.
- The Playwright browser-test harness is a separate synthetic environment. It may bind to a dynamic loopback origin, but it must pass the resolved origin into the Playwright browser context and permission grants.
- There is no server backend in the runtime path. `getUserMedia()` and device enumeration must stay client-side.

## Browser Media Test Harness

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UITests["PrompterOne.App.UITests"]
    Fixture["StandaloneAppFixture"]
    InitScript["synthetic-media-harness.js<br/>BrowserContext.addInitScript"]
    Browser["Chromium context<br/>dynamic loopback origin + granted permissions"]
    MediaApis["navigator.mediaDevices<br/>enumerateDevices + getUserMedia"]
    Synthetic["Synthetic cameras + microphone<br/>canvas.captureStream + Web Audio"]
    Reader["Teleprompter runtime"]
    GoLive["Go Live preview/runtime"]

    UITests --> Fixture
    Fixture --> InitScript
    Fixture --> Browser
    InitScript --> MediaApis
    MediaApis --> Synthetic
    Reader --> MediaApis
    GoLive --> MediaApis
```

- Browser acceptance now installs a deterministic synthetic media harness before page scripts run.
- The static SPA host now binds to a dynamic loopback HTTP port and exposes the resolved origin through the fixture.
- The harness overrides `enumerateDevices()` and `getUserMedia()` inside the Playwright browser context only.
- Synthetic video comes from `canvas.captureStream()`.
- Synthetic audio comes from `AudioContext.createMediaStreamDestination()`.
- `teleprompter`, `settings`, and `go-live` tests assert real `MediaStream` attachment through `video.srcObject`, not only CSS state.

If a native embedded browser host returns later, media access must not rely on system permission alone. Follow the dedicated macOS note in [MacEmbeddedWebViewPermissions.md](./MacEmbeddedWebViewPermissions.md).

## Project Responsibilities

### `src/PrompterOne.App`

- standalone Blazor WebAssembly host
- serves the app shell and static asset references
- applies browser-language culture selection before the WASM runtime starts rendering routed UI
- must stay free of server-only runtime dependencies

### `src/PrompterOne.Shared`

- routed Razor screens: `library`, `editor`, `learn`, `teleprompter`, `go-live`, `settings`
- vertical slices own their routed pages, components, renderers, and feature-local services under folders such as `Editor/`, `Library/`, `Teleprompter/`, and `GoLive/`
- only true cross-cutting UI assets stay outside feature slices: `Contracts/`, `Localization/`, `wwwroot/`, root bootstrap files, and `AppShell/`
- exact design shell and imported `design` assets
- shared UI localization catalog for supported browser cultures
- browser interop and app DI wiring
- browser-backed `IUserSettingsStore` wiring for persisted reader, theme, scene, and studio preferences
- dynamic library folder components and folder/document browser storage adapters
- UI diagnostics banner and global error boundary
- debounced editor autosave and body-only TPS source authoring
- centered RSVP ORP playback in `learn`
- single background camera layer under text in `teleprompter`
- teleprompter reader preferences persist through `IUserSettingsStore`, including font scale, text width, focal position, and camera auto-start preference
- dedicated `go-live` routing surface that arms multiple live destinations while reusing the same browser-composed scene
- settings split between device setup (`settings`) and destination routing (`go-live`)

Rules:

- keep markup aligned with `design`
- do not move business logic here if it belongs in `Core`
- preserve `data-testid` selectors for browser tests

### `src/PrompterOne.Core`

- feature slices keep related abstractions, models, previews, and services together under `Tps/`, `Editor/`, `Workspace/`, `Library/`, `Rsvp/`, `Media/`, and `Streaming/`
- TPS parser, compiler, exporter
- RSVP helpers
- workspace state and preview generation
- media scene and streaming descriptor models

Rules:

- no Blazor dependencies
- no JS interop
- no host-specific APIs

## Test Topology

    AppTests --> Shared["src/PrompterOne.Shared"]
    UiTests --> App["src/PrompterOne.App"]
```

## Test Strategy

- `PrompterOne.Core.Tests`: domain correctness and regression tests grouped by core slice plus `Support/`
- `PrompterOne.App.Tests`: bUnit coverage grouped by routed feature slice plus `Support/`
- `PrompterOne.App.UITests`: Playwright browser flows grouped by browser feature slice plus `Infrastructure/`, `Scenarios/`, `Media/`, and `Support/`

## Constraints

- The runtime must remain backend-free.
- `Go Live` may operate only one upstream browser broadcast spine per session; direct parallel browser fan-out to multiple platform transports is outside the allowed boundary.
- `Go Live` must not require any PrompterOne-owned backend, relay, ingest layer, or media server; only third-party browser-facing transport infrastructure is allowed.
- Browser-language localization must default to English and support `en`, `uk`, `fr`, `es`, `pt`, and `it`.
- Russian is intentionally unsupported and must fall back to English.
- Visual fidelity should prefer copying the exact design classes and structure over inventing replacements.
- Browser tests require Playwright Chromium to be installed locally.
- Build verification is expected to pass with `-warnaserror`.
- Editor metadata belongs in the right metadata rail and must not be rendered as visible front matter in the source editor.
- `learn` must keep the ORP letter aligned to the center guide while stepping words.
- `teleprompter` must render camera only as a background layer; overlay camera boxes are not part of the current reference UI.
- If macOS embedding returns later, use a persistent `WKWebView` data store, a stable trusted origin, and explicit `requestMediaCapturePermissionFor` handling so camera and microphone prompts are not repeated on every launch.
