# Full Suite Stabilization

## Goal

Get the full local `PrompterOne` build and automated test baseline green across all projects, then publish the validated fix directly to `main` and monitor the downstream GitHub Actions release path until it is green or a concrete external blocker is identified.

## Scope

In scope:
- full local solution build and test verification
- fixes in test support, UI test suites, and production code only where required to remove real regressions
- direct push to `main` after local validation
- post-push CI and release monitoring, with follow-up fixes if the remote pipeline fails

Out of scope:
- unrelated user-owned or parallel in-flight changes that are not required for the failing baseline
- broad feature work unrelated to the failing tests or release pipeline

## Constraints And Risks

- Respect the root `AGENTS.md` command contract and use the solution-level build/test commands.
- Do not hide browser flakiness behind timeout inflation or reduced coverage.
- Keep mutating editor tests isolated per draft/script and extend that principle to other stateful browser scenarios if needed.
- Keep the diff limited to the test-support and editor test files required for stabilization.
- Pushing directly to `main` is explicitly requested, but only after the validated state is green locally.

## Testing Methodology

- Establish the real baseline with the required solution-level build and test commands.
- For every failing test:
  - reproduce locally
  - identify the owning suite and root cause
  - apply the narrowest durable fix
  - rerun the failing project or focused class first
  - rerun the broader required regression layer
- Before push:
  - rerun the full local solution test command
- After push:
  - monitor the relevant GitHub Actions/release run
  - if a remote failure appears, inspect the failing job/log and iterate until green or explicitly blocked

## Baseline And Tracked Failures

- [x] Run `dotnet build ./PrompterOne.slnx -warnaserror`.
- [x] Run `dotnet test @./tests/dotnet-test-progress.rsp --solution ./PrompterOne.slnx --max-parallel-test-modules 1`.

Tracked failing tests from the current baseline:

- [x] `EditorAiAvailabilityTests.EditorScreen_AiButtonsAreDisabled_WhenNoProviderIsConfigured`
  Symptom:
  - solution-level run observed the `editor-ai` action enabled when the test expected it to be disabled
  Root cause:
  - the disabled-path test relied on a "fresh enough" browser context, but a configured-provider test earlier in the suite left AI-related browser state that made this case order-dependent
  Fix path:
  - seed an explicit default `AiProviderSettings` payload for the disabled-path test before opening the editor so the test never depends on prior browser state
- [x] `EditorMinimapLayoutTests.EditorScreen_MonacoMinimapStaysVisibleInsideEditorStage`
  Symptom:
  - intermittent timeout waiting for `editor-page` before the minimap assertions began
  Root cause:
  - the test used the shorter default visible timeout before Monaco readiness and could fail under editor-suite startup pressure
  Fix path:
  - remove the redundant short page-visible gate, rely on the Monaco-ready helper, and allow isolated page retry on transient page/context closure
- [x] `EditorToolbarCoverageTests.EditorToolbar_FloatingCommandButton_MutatesSource(...editor-float-pause-short-menu...)`
  Symptom:
  - intermittent `Target page, context or browser has been closed` during `GotoAsync` inside `OpenEditorAsync`
  Root cause:
  - the reported failure was reproduced only while overlapping browser-suite `dotnet test` processes were fighting over the shared Playwright/browser runtime; the scenario itself passes in a clean single-process editor-suite run
  Fix path:
  - keep browser-suite execution to one local `dotnet test` process at a time and retain the isolated-page retry boundary for genuinely recoverable page/context closure during bootstrap
- [x] `EditorMonacoAssistanceFlowTests.EditorScreen_ProvidesMonacoTpsCompletionLabel(...)`
  Symptom:
  - the full editor-suite rerun now fails all `16` completion-label data cases while timing out inside `EditorIsolatedDraftDriver.WaitForAssignedScriptRouteAsync`
  Root cause:
  - the new isolated-draft helper waits for an autosaved persisted `?id=` route, but this completion scenario intentionally opens Monaco on the raw in-progress text `"["` where persistence is not the contract under test
  Fix path:
  - keep the helper strict by default, but opt this completion scenario out of persisted-route waiting and verify the data-driven case family goes green again
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24199073318` reports a `Shell` bootstrap cluster (`44` failing tests)
  Symptom:
  - many unrelated shell, library, onboarding, settings, localization, diagnostics, and tooltip tests time out on their first routed-surface visibility assertion, most commonly `library-page`
  Root cause:
  - the browser-suite process starts parallel isolated contexts against a cold shared runtime, so the first routed page bootstrap can miss the standard per-test visibility window on CI even though the warmed local suite later passes
  Fix path:
  - add a one-time shared-runtime warmup path in the browser harness so the suite pays the cold-start cost before parallel tests begin
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24199073318` reports a `Studio` bootstrap cluster (`37` failing tests)
  Symptom:
  - go-live, settings, media, and studio workflow tests all time out on their first routed-surface visibility assertion, usually while `SeedGoLiveSceneForReuseAsync` waits for `library-page`
  Root cause:
  - the studio suite is hitting the same cold-start bootstrap pressure as `Shell`, but the failures fan out through GoLive/media helpers because those helpers seed state only after the first shell route becomes interactive
  Fix path:
  - reuse the shared-runtime warmup so the first library/settings/go-live routes are already booted before studio scenarios start seeding or asserting
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24203100281` still reports cold fresh-context bootstrap failures after the shared-runtime warmup
  Symptom:
  - `Shell` and `Studio` still fail on the first visible page assertion for a newly created browser context, and editor-only scenarios can still hit context/page closure while opening the first routed page inside a fresh context
  Root cause:
  - the earlier hypothesis was incomplete; the added CI-only sacrificial per-context warmup made CI bootstrap behavior diverge from local runs and added extra routed app startup work before every returned test page
  Fix path:
  - remove the CI-only per-context routed warmup, keep only the one-time shared-runtime warmup, and make every returned test page follow the same bootstrap path locally and on CI
- [ ] `StandaloneAppFixture` build break: `WarmUpContextPageIfNeededAsync` missing in `StandaloneAppFixture.cs`
- [x] `StandaloneAppFixture` build break: `WarmUpContextPageIfNeededAsync` missing in `StandaloneAppFixture.cs`
  Symptom:
  - compiler reports `CS0103` for `WarmUpContextPageIfNeededAsync` from `tests/PrompterOne.Web.UITests/Infrastructure/StandaloneAppFixture.cs`
  Root cause:
  - the warmup helper had already been split into the partial fixture, but the published tree and the active fixture callers drifted until the shared warmup path and callers were brought back into the same compiled partial surface
  Fix path:
  - keep the helper in the compiled partial, align the callers with that partial surface, and prove the fix with the required local build and full solution test commands
- [x] `EditorDragDropFlowTests.EditorScreen_DropOnEmptyDraft_ReplacesTextAndSupportsUndoRedo`
  Symptom:
  - the blank-draft drop scenario updated the source text and title but intermittently left toolbar undo disabled, especially once untitled autosave assigned a real `?id=` route
  Root cause:
  - dropping onto an untitled draft triggered autosave self-navigation that reloaded the editor and reset document history, so slower runs could lose undo state before the assertion clicked it
  Fix path:
  - preserve editor history across untitled autosave self-navigation and make the browser regression wait for the persisted route before asserting undo/redo on the post-save editor surface
- [ ] `Release Pipeline` run `24209085607` still fails on GitHub macOS despite the local full-suite baseline being green on the same `727d904` commit
  Symptom:
  - `Shell` and `Studio` fail remotely while local `dotnet build`, targeted suite runs, and the required solution-level `dotnet test` all pass on the exact pushed commit
  - downloaded CI screenshots show routed UI rendering successfully but staying on `library-page` for failing `Shell` scenarios instead of navigating into the requested editor/reader flow
  - `Studio` artifacts currently include intermediate scenario screenshots but not explicit `failure-*` captures, which suggests some failures still occur before the normal `AppUiTestBase` failure-capture path runs
  Root cause:
  - the current evidence points to a harness divergence and storage-coupling issue, not a broken visual tree or missing compiled assets
  - CI currently warms the returned isolated page to `Library` before the test sees it, while local runs return a blank primed page
  - mutable library/settings seed state is also being injected via `AddInitScript`, so every navigation can partially reseed browser storage instead of relying only on the explicit isolated reset-and-seed step
  Fix path:
  - preserve and inspect CI screenshot artifacts for each failing run, then harden the fresh-context bootstrap so local and CI both receive the same blank primed page
  - remove mutable library/settings seeding from `AddInitScript`, keep explicit isolated reset+seed only, and make blocked IndexedDB reset fail fast instead of silently succeeding
- [ ] `Release Pipeline` run `24218745809` fails in `Shell` (`27` tests) and `Studio` (`5` tests) after the direct `main` push on commit `4bea2cd`
  Symptom:
  - `Shell` now fails broadly on the very first routed page visibility checks for `library-page` and `settings-page`, with screenshots showing the shell UI eventually rendered after the assertion already timed out
  - `Studio` fails on initial `library-page` visibility in go-live setup plus a smaller cluster of route-return clicks that stay on `/go-live?id=...`
  Root cause:
  - the CI-only sacrificial per-context warmup still makes every new context pay extra routed bootstrap work that local runs never execute
  - `Shell` still opens many routes with raw `GotoAsync(...)` plus one-shot `ToBeVisibleAsync(...)` checks instead of the shared retrying route driver, so slower CI bootstrap falls straight into suite-wide flakes
  - `Studio` route-open and go-live-return flows still rely on root-page readiness alone instead of a stronger page-ready contract before clicking or waiting for downstream session state
  Fix path:
  - remove the per-context routed warmup so local and CI use the same isolated-page bootstrap path
  - introduce shared shell route-open helpers and migrate raw shell route opens onto `BrowserRouteDriver`
  - strengthen go-live route readiness in the studio helpers before interaction-heavy assertions
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24199073318` reports a `Reader` bootstrap cluster (`163` failing tests)
  Symptom:
  - learn, teleprompter, responsive, and route-visibility tests all fail at the initial `learn-page`, `teleprompter-page`, `settings-page`, `go-live-page`, `editor-page`, or `library-page` visibility gate
  Root cause:
  - the reader suite opens many isolated contexts directly against a cold runtime, so route bootstrap dominates the first assertion and cascades into nearly every reader-facing scenario
  Fix path:
  - preload the shared runtime once across the core routed surfaces so reader tests keep their existing assertions while avoiding cold-boot CI starvation
- [x] `TeleprompterAlignmentTooltipFlowTests.TeleprompterScreen_LeftRailTooltips_AppearOnlyAfterDelayAndStayOutsideButtons`
  Symptom:
  - the tooltip still remains visible intermittently during the dismiss assertion in the solution-level run
  Root cause:
  - the current hover-clear path still depends on incidental hover behavior; moving to `teleprompter-stage` was not deterministic enough under full-suite pressure
  Fix path:
  - replace the dismiss step with a deterministic pointer move to a measured non-trigger point on a production-owned surface and prove it under the reader project plus solution-level run
- [x] `TeleprompterAlignmentTooltipFlowTests.TeleprompterScreen_RightRailTooltips_AppearOnlyAfterDelayAndStayOutsideSliders`
  Symptom:
  - the width-slider tooltip still remains visible intermittently during the dismiss assertion in the solution-level run
  Root cause:
  - the right-rail tooltip test shares the same non-deterministic hover-clear path as the left-rail case
  Fix path:
  - reuse the deterministic measured pointer-move dismissal path so the test exits the tooltip anchor through a known safe region
- [x] `ReaderPlaybackTimingTests.LearnTimingProbe_UserSpeedChange_ChangesWordByWordTiming`
  Symptom:
  - the detailed slow/fast per-word timing assertions pass, but the final aggregate playback-span comparison sometimes reports fast playback completing later than slow playback
  Root cause:
  - the current total-span comparison includes startup and tail jitter that is looser than the already-proven per-word timing checks
  Fix path:
  - compare a more stable derived timing measure from the recorded samples so the assertion proves speed ordering without depending on first/last-sample jitter
- [x] `EditorThemeFlowTests.EditorScreen_LightTheme_EmotionMenu_UsesReadableDropdownAndCustomTooltipOnly`
  Symptom:
  - the solution-level run can observe the custom editor tooltip while it is still fading in, so the tooltip is visible but opacity remains below the required fully-rendered threshold
  Root cause:
  - the test relies on a fixed settle delay before asserting final tooltip opacity instead of waiting for the tooltip to finish its CSS fade-in under slower full-suite conditions
  Fix path:
  - replace the fixed-delay final tooltip assertion with a deterministic wait that polls the dedicated tooltip `data-test` surface until opacity reaches the required threshold
- [x] `EditorToolbarTooltipFlowTests.EditorScreen_DropdownTooltip_StaysOutsideMenuAndDoesNotBlockAction`
  Symptom:
  - the solution-level run observed the "early tooltip opacity" check after the tooltip had already started fading in, even though the same project-level editor run still passed
  Root cause:
  - the test mixed a fixed wall-clock sleep with a CSS-delay contract, so slower solution-level execution could consume enough time between `HoverAsync` and the assertion for the tooltip fade-in to have already started
  Fix path:
  - assert the low-opacity state immediately after hover, then rely on the existing tooltip driver to wait for the real visible state instead of stacking extra fixed settle sleeps
- [x] `Reader` route bootstrap/readiness hardening after the `24218745809` CI failures
  Symptom:
  - remote reader failures clustered around first-route `learn-page` visibility timeouts while the same commit stayed green locally
  Root cause:
  - the shared reader route helper treated the routed page root as "ready" too early, so slower CI could advance into shortcut/playback assertions before the interactive learn or teleprompter controls were actually present
  Fix path:
  - strengthen `ReaderRouteDriver` to wait for production-owned interactive sentinels (`learn` progress/play controls, teleprompter stage/play toggle, settings title) instead of stopping at the top-level page shell
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24220487918` fails remotely in `Reader`, `Shell`, and `Studio` after commit `9187967`
  Symptom:
  - the local full-solution baseline stayed green, but GitHub macOS jobs timed out during initial route opens across `/library`, `/settings`, `/editor?id=...`, and `/go-live?id=...`
  - remote job logs showed shared route helpers blocking inside `GotoAsync(... WaitUntil = NetworkIdle)` before the routed surface assertions even began
  Root cause:
  - the shared browser route driver still used `WaitUntilState.NetworkIdle`, which is too strict for production-shaped pages that keep browser activity alive on CI
  - this created a remote-only harness divergence where route-open retries could stall before the explicit page sentinel checks had a chance to run
  Fix path:
  - switch shared route open and blank-page bounce navigation in `BrowserRouteDriver` from `NetworkIdle` to `Load`
  - continue treating route readiness as an explicit contract enforced by URL and `data-test` sentinels rather than by global network quiescence
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24221016454` still fails remotely in `Shell`, `Studio`, and `Reader` after commit `5db317c`
  Symptom:
  - `Shell`, `Studio`, and `Reader` now fail inside `BrowserRouteDriver.IsPageVisibleAsync(...)` while waiting for first routed sentinels such as `library-page`, `settings-page`, and `teleprompter-page`
  - remote Playwright screenshots show the routed UI fully rendered by the time failure artifacts are captured, which means the page is starting successfully but missing the existing readiness budget
  Root cause:
  - the remaining problem is the first routed boot from a freshly primed `/_test/blank` page in a brand-new isolated browser context
  - CI macOS runners can need materially longer than the standard `15s` visible timeout for that first WebAssembly route to finish rendering even though later in-context route transitions are fast
  - the CI-only blank bounce retry was not helping this case because it can interrupt or restart the very first route bootstrap instead of letting the initial boot finish
  Fix path:
  - detect when `BrowserRouteDriver` is opening the first routed page from the primed blank test page
  - give only that first routed bootstrap the longer runtime-warmup visibility budget and skip the CI blank bounce for that specific path
  - keep the shorter route-visible contract for already-booted routed pages so normal suite latency does not drift upward
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24221639706` fails remotely in all four browser suites after commit `7983efe`
  Symptom:
  - `Shell` fails `11` tests, mostly while opening `/library`, plus two invalid learn/teleprompter missing-script flows and two onboarding route-changing clicks
  - `Studio` fails `6` tests, split between first-route `/library` boot, `go-live-back` hangs, and `StartRecording` click paths that stall on scheduled navigation waits
  - `Reader` fails `3` tests: two responsive-layout screenshot captures on iPad Pro portrait and one teleprompter muted-chrome visual threshold
  - `Editor` fails multiple route-changing action tests, including `Open in Library` from split results and import/drag-drop flows that do not wait on the real completion signal
  Root cause:
  - `BrowserRouteDriver` still lets `TimeoutException` escape from the page-visible probe, so the shared route retry loop is bypassed on CI
  - the harness still contains route/open divergence between runtime warmup and scenario route opens, and shared contexts can be published before priming fully succeeds
  - several suites still use raw SPA clicks that wait for scheduled navigation even though the tests already do explicit post-click route or readiness waits
  - responsive screenshot capture is still a one-shot operation, so artifact generation itself can fail otherwise healthy route assertions
  - a production Go Live route-leave path still blocks navigation on camera detach work
  Fix path:
  - make route-open retries catch timeout failures at the shared driver boundary and remove CI-only route-open behavior
  - publish shared contexts only after priming succeeds and reuse the shared route driver from runtime warmup
  - introduce a shared `NoWaitAfter` click helper for SPA route/state-changing controls and use it in the failing Shell, Studio, and Editor flows
  - retry page screenshot capture in the shared artifact helper
  - stop awaiting camera detach inside `GoLivePage` location-changing so route leaves are not blocked by cleanup
  Result:
  - local follow-up validation is fully green after hardening SPA route-changing clicks, library/settings route reload helpers, go-live back navigation, selected-program-source visibility checks, and the brittle teleprompter reverse-transition assertion
  - targeted suite reruns passed with `Shell 51/51`, `Studio 38/38`, `Reader 168/168`, and `Editor 284/284`
  - the required post-format solution verification passed with `1162/1162`
- [x] `StandaloneAppFixture` shared-context creation still exposed accidental cross-test coupling
  Symptom:
  - the browser harness still defaulted `NewPageAsync()` to the shared-storage path, so any missing `additionalContext: true` quietly joined a shared browser context and became order-dependent under CI parallelism
  - shared-context bootstrap failures could also leave a poisoned shared context cached for later reuse
  Root cause:
  - isolation was opt-in instead of the default browser-harness contract
  - shared-context creation was not explicit enough, and retry eviction only handled a narrow closed-browser exception path
  Fix path:
  - switch `StandaloneAppFixture.NewPageAsync()` to isolated-by-default
  - add explicit `NewSharedPageAsync(...)` / explicit-key `NewSharedPagesAsync(...)` APIs for the few real shared-tab scenarios
  - evict and dispose shared contexts on any blank-page bootstrap failure before retrying
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24233338921` fails remotely in `Reader`, `Editor`, and `Studio` after commit `6ec9d87`
  Symptom:
  - `Studio` route-heavy flows regress at `go-live-back` and related return paths even though first-route boot is already green
  - `Reader` still flakes in timing-sensitive playback assertions and the reverse previous-block transition despite the broad route bootstrap fixes
  - `Editor` still has route-changing action flows that pass locally in focused runs but fail under the full remote/browser load when they rely on raw navigation opens or brittle blur clicks
  Root cause:
  - some SPA route-changing controls still used raw Playwright clicks that waited for scheduled navigation instead of following the shared no-wait interaction contract
  - the remaining reader timing assertion budget did not account for the sample-poll granularity, and one reverse-transition test still mixed a poisoned pre-click baseline into its motion proof
  - a few editor scenarios still bypassed the shared route drivers or depended on a raw click outside the metadata rail to commit field changes
  Fix path:
  - move the remaining SPA route-changing interactions onto the shared `ClickAndContinueAsync(..., noWaitAfter: true)` path
  - harden reader timing and reverse-transition assertions against poll jitter while keeping the user-visible behavior contract intact
  - route editor open/theme/split/title flows through the shared route helpers and interaction driver so local and CI follow the same readiness path
- [x] `Release Pipeline` run `24234983323` fails remotely in `Shell` and `Editor` after commit `ee5f0fb`
  Symptom:
  - `Shell` still times out in a small route-transition cluster where the UI remains on `library-page` after import/playback actions instead of completing the intended move into `editor`, `learn`, or `reader`
  - `Editor` still flakes in local-history flows, with one test timing out after opening `/settings` and another timing out after a raw page reload while the editor is already visibly present
  Root cause:
  - several remaining SPA route-changing clicks were still using default Playwright navigation waiting instead of the shared no-wait click contract plus explicit route-ready waits, so CI could stall on scheduled client-side transitions
  - some return-to-editor paths only waited for `editor-page` instead of full Monaco readiness
  - `EditorLocalHistoryFlowTests` still bypassed the shared route helpers with raw `GotoAsync("/settings")` and raw `ReloadAsync()`, which made the tests diverge from the rest of the browser harness under slower remote startup
  Fix path:
  - move the remaining route-changing shell, reader, and studio clicks onto `UiInteractionDriver.ClickAndContinueAsync(..., noWaitAfter: true)` where the test already owns the post-click readiness contract
  - upgrade learn/teleprompter/editor return waits to the shared ready helpers so route completion is measured by the real interactive surface, not just the shell frame
  - route editor local-history settings/reload operations through `ShellRouteDriver.OpenSettingsAsync(...)` and `BrowserRouteDriver.ReloadPageAsync(...)` so local and CI share the same readiness path

## Ordered Plan

- [x] Step 1. Capture the full local build baseline.
  Actions:
  - run the required solution build command
  - record any build failures with exact file ownership
  Verification:
  - build completes successfully or every blocking error is captured in the tracked-failures section

- [x] Step 2. Capture the full local test baseline.
  Actions:
  - run the required solution-level `dotnet test` command
  - record each failing project/test name in the tracked-failures section with a short root-cause note
  Verification:
  - the plan contains an explicit checklist entry for every current failing test or failing project

- [x] Step 3. Stabilize failing suites one by one.
  Actions:
  - fix the first failing suite starting from the smallest reproducible scope
  - keep a running root-cause note and intended fix path for each failure
  - repeat until all tracked failures are closed
  Verification:
  - repaired `Reader` and `Editor` projects pass locally; remaining open work is the full solution rerun plus any remote-only CI fallout

- [x] Step 4. Re-run the full local solution verification.
  Actions:
  - rerun the required solution build and solution test commands
  - rerun `dotnet format ./PrompterOne.slnx`
  Verification:
  - local build passes
  - local full test pass count is green across all projects
  - formatting completes cleanly
  Result:
  - `dotnet format ./PrompterOne.slnx` passed
  - `dotnet build ./PrompterOne.slnx -warnaserror` passed
  - `dotnet test @./tests/dotnet-test-progress.rsp --solution ./PrompterOne.slnx --max-parallel-test-modules 1` passed with `1162/1162` green in `7m 42.943s`
  - post-format verification repeated successfully with `dotnet build ./PrompterOne.slnx -warnaserror` and `dotnet test @./tests/dotnet-test-progress.rsp --solution ./PrompterOne.slnx --max-parallel-test-modules 1`, ending at `1162/1162` green in `7m 35.996s`
  - latest post-remediation verification repeated successfully with `dotnet format ./PrompterOne.slnx`, `dotnet build ./PrompterOne.slnx -warnaserror`, and `dotnet test @./tests/dotnet-test-progress.rsp --solution ./PrompterOne.slnx --max-parallel-test-modules 1`, ending at `1162/1162` green in `7m 47.418s`

- [ ] Step 5. Publish directly to `main`.
  Actions:
  - stage only the task-scoped stabilization files
  - commit the validated fix
  - push to `origin/main`
  Verification:
  - the remote push succeeds

- [ ] Step 6. Watch the remote CI/release path and react to failures.
  Actions:
  - monitor the relevant GitHub Actions run(s) for the pushed commit
  - download and inspect Playwright screenshot artifacts from failing browser jobs while the run is still active so each follow-up fix is grounded in the actual remote UI state
  - if any job fails, inspect logs, apply the fix, rerun local validation, and push the follow-up
  Verification:
  - the release path is green or an explicit external blocker is documented
